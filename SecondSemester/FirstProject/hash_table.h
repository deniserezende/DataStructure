/* Functions: */

// (1) Note that: 'compare_item_unformatted_key' receives two items
// Must compare both by there unformatted key.
// if item to be inserted is greater than current item, compare should return number > 0
// if item to be inserted is less than current item, compare should return number < 0
// if both items are equal, compare should return 0
// Btw: remember the formatted key has to be a long

// (2) Note that: 'condition' receives one item
// Function should return a long value either 1 or 0.

// (3) Note that: 'deallocate' receives one item
// You can use deallocate function to get the data from item before it is deleted
// We strongly sugest you deallocate the space you malloced for the item

// (4) Note that: 'action' receives one item
// This function cannot include a deletion

// (5) Note that: 'get_item_key' receives one item
// Must return the item key which has to be a long

// (6) Note that: 'delete_this_item' receives one item
// Must return if the item sent is or is not the right one to delete
// Note that: the return value must be a long either 1 or 0.

// (7) Note that: 'this_item' receives one items
// Must return if the item sent is or is not the one you are looking for.
// Note that: the return value must be a long either 1 or 0.
